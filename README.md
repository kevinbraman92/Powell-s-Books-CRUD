This app was my team's portfolio project submission for CS 340 INTRODUCTION TO DATABASES. 

This app includes a website demonstrating CRUD coded in HTML, styled with CSS, and connected to a MySQL database through JavaScript.

The database is prepopulated through the use of the DDL.sql file and additional data manipulation of the database through the website is enabled by a DML.sql file.
